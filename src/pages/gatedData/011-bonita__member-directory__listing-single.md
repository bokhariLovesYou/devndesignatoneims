### [Listing Single](https://bonitaprod.wpengine.com/listing/naples-daily/)

The listing single page changes based on the membership level a member may have. The screenshot below shows the single page for an enhanced listing type.

**Enhanced listings** get a **Business Description, Images, YouTube iFrame and a form** for our users to contact them from. Paid listings, on the other hand do not get these features. Below is a representation of how these may render on the frontend for our users to access.

> When a user submits the contact form - the information is sent to the 'Account Owner' of the listing - which is the billing contact.

**Paid Listings** on the other hand may just get the basics. Below is an example of the Listing Single page for a paid listing.
