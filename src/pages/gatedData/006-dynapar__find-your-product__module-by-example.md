## Module by Example

We'll be using our module to recreate this example:
![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/nK8hyU4.png)

First, we'd be populating our Level One fields.

And adding two Inner Question Groups. They'd be for **Absoltute** and **Incremental** in this use case.

Under Absolute, we'd nest an **inner question**

And give some **options (with links)** to our inner question.

This would be a good time to test how our module looks right now. We'd preview it in a new window to see how the Absolute Option responds to our user's actions.

We'd be able to see our Product Finder Module at the bottom of the page right after the content ends.

Once we select **Absolute** we'll see our **Nested Inner Question** with its **Inner Options** as demonstrated by the screenshot below.

Once we click on one of the inner options, we'd see our final URL/Destination button.

This works as expected, therefore we'd go back to our editor and fill out the inner question as well as the inner options for Incremental.

And now, on the live preview, once we click on Incremental, we'd see its nested options on the frontend.

Selecting one of the inner options will show us its Destination Button.

> **Please Note:** The button's text is set to populate dynamically from the options selected.
