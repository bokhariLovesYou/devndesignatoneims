The Product Page template supports **Flexible Columns** (a feature HubSpot Page Templates has to add **new modules on demand**) - therefore, we can simply go to **Contents** and click on **Add New Module**:

That pops up a modal from where we can search for our Product Finder module and add it.

This would show the module in ‘Contents’ from where we can edit the fields to our preferences.

We also added some additional fields such as:

**Equip Width:** This Equips the width of our module so that it doesn’t take the container’s whole width.

**Centered:** This centers our module (works when Equip Width is toggled on)

**Larger Heading**: Makes the heading a little larger.

The module may look like this when all these three options are toggled on.

> For a template which does not support Flexible Columns, we’d need to add it to that specific template from the Design Manager.
