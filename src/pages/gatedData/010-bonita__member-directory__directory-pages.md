> This document discusses some of the pages which are accessible through
> the frontend to all of our users.

### [Membership page](https://bonitaprod.wpengine.com/membership/)

The membership page lets our users purchase a membership. It serves as the main marketing page for our membership portal.

**[Directory Page](https://bonitaprod.wpengine.com/business-directory/)**
The directory page is where our users can search for different listings. Mainly, the algorithm queries the name, category and city of a listing in order to provide users for what they may be looking for.

When we enter a keyword to search for, say - **naples** - it takes us to the 'Search Listings Page'.

This page may consist of all the listings which have **naples** either in the title or the address.

Additionally, we can refine our search by category using the dropdown menu in our search bar.

The **Show on Map** button takes us to the top of the viewport in order to make the locality of the business more prominent to our user using Google Maps.

The **Get Directions** button takes our user to Google Maps if they may require directions for that specific locality.

The **Visit Site** button takes our user to the business website which opens up in a new window.

The **Learn More** button takes our user to the listing's single page which resides within our portal which we may discuss in the next chapters.

Additionally, paid listings may not have a blue header as our enhanced listings have.

All the pages are completely responsive and have been made accessible for our mobile users.
