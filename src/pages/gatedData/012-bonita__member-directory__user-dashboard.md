> This document discusses pages within our user dashboard.

### Home

When a user logs in to as a member to our site - they'd be redirected to our user dashboard

### Change Password

The **Change Password** page lets our members change their password. By default, WordPress doesn't allow us to change the 'username' of a user - therefore, on this page - they may request a password reset.

When they fill out this form - they may receive an email notification that their password was successfully changed.

### Business Information

Depending upon the membership type, if a member is able to add multiple listings - they are able to do so by clicking 'Listing One'.

> Please Note: For memberships which support only one listing - the title for this navigational item changes to **Update Your Business Information**

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/kijBbOQ.png)

These forms are validated, and would prompt an error if a required field is missing (which are all in this case) or doesn't match the **type** of the input field.

Phone numbers are automatically formatted to have brackets. Same is the case with websites, and are automatically formatted.

Additionally, when a user starts typing their **street address** they may be prompted an auto fill dropdown.
![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/n8xlp5y.png)
which completes our other fields.
![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/xbhqF4P.png)

By clicking the **Add New Listing** button - our members can add an additional listing. The same form may be provided to them.

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/ZBxi6Cs.png)

> Please Note: Depending upon the membership level, some fields may or may not be visible to our members. For example, in this case - this test account is on a **Community Connector** Plan - which doesn't support Business Description.

Upon publishing a listing, our member will get redirected to that specific membership in order to make any additional edits.

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/gFZmOj7.png)

Upon making edits to the listing, they'd be provided a success message.

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/i56mQOZ.png)

If the plan doesn't support additional listings - the **Add New Listing** button renders a gated pop up asking for our user to upgrade.

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/HF4Ku2C.png)

This button takes our member to the billing page (more information on this can be found at the bottom).

#### Media Update

Depending upon their membership type, our members can add media on this page.
![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/yqoNdOm.png)

> Please Note: In this case - this test account is on a **Community Connector** Plan - which doesn't support multiple images as well as the YouTube embed.

The choose file button prompts the media gallery for a member and they can add or upload the image they may like.

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/RFDizwc.png)

Or we can choose from the existing ones.
![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/6lTxxvl.png)

**If no file is chosen as the logo - our listing gets a generic avatar.**

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/N1ly3eS.png)

Once we add the logo and save - we'd be prompted with the same success messaage.

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/xJI4URV.png)

Which updates our listing on the frontend.

### Account Users

Our members can use this page to edit or add new corporate accounts.
![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/ayZXVix.png)

![Billing account is able to](https://i.imgur.com/xT4KY9p.png)

Billing account is able to add new users and edit the existing ones, whereas the sub accounts are only able to edit their own account on this page.

When a billing account adds a new user, they get an email to reset their password and are attached to this specific membrship.

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/Lcolw2N.png)

> Please note: When a user changes their email address, they will be sent an email on the new email address primarily to log in and confirm this email change using their previous email address.

### Pay Your Bills

This is the page where our billing contact (not visible to our corporate accounts) can update their card information or change their plan.
![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/gqgyarK.png)

Our billing contact may see their memberpress transactions in this column.
![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/X1FA2Ej.png)

If they have also purchased a WooCommerce product, those transactions may appear beneath this table as well.

Additionally, our users may change their plan by clicking the **Change Plan** button.

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/7NoSrfH.png)

> Please Note: Only the billing contact may be able to change the plan.

Once they change the plan - they'd be redirected to the 'register' page again to add their billing information.

On the transactions table, we'll be able to see this new transaction.

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/D4U99za.png)

Additionally, as we upgraded our plan to Power Partner - we're now able to add additional images and a youtube embed video

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/j4hTzK1.png)

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/Duz4BRY.png)

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/P7DoQJ0.png)

Which may update our listing as required.

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/TkfqObY.jpg)

We're also able to add a business description now.

> Please Note: If a member downgrades from a plan which previously allowed two or more listings - the first listing will remain public whereas the others will be converted to drafts.

### Member Resources

All the member resources currently link out.

The President's Club is only visible to our billing contacts - whereas Benefits and FAQ are gated (that is, only accessible to our members).

> Please Note: Please let us know if we'd like to keep FAQ within our dashboard.
