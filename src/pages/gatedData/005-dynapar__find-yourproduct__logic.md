We'll be learning how we can add inner options as well as **level two** questions in our module under this article.

> Please Note: The fonts have been **zoomed in** to show different elements in the module.

Right beneath Question Help URL - we'll see a field for **Inner Question Group**. This field is what we call a [Repeater](https://designers.hubspot.com/blog/repeating-fields-in-the-new-module-framework) field in HubSpot. In summary, we can add these fields multiple times in our module.

## Add an Inner Question Group

Please click on **Add One** in order to add an Inner Question

Once we click **Add** - we'd be greeted by two fields under our group.

- One for **Option Title**
- The other one for **Select an Action**

### Option Title

The **Option Title** field is the title of our option.

### Select an Action

The **Select an Action** field is a _dropdown_ - which provides us the ability to either connect our second question with this specific option, or to provide a URL where we want the users to go if they select this option.

### Add Destination

If we click on _Add Destination_ - we'll be prompted with another field: **Option Destination**. This field takes a URL and ends our _Question Chain_. That is, when this option is selected by the user - they'd be prompted with a Button which would leave to **this** url.

## Add Inner Question

If we select **Add Inner Question** - we are prompted by 3 more fields. These fields let us nest another question and add options for them.

### Inner Question Title

This is the Nested Question's title - which will be shown when the user selects its parents' option.

### Inner Question Help URL

This field is for the **Nested Question's** _Help URL_

> Please Note: All the nested fields render whenever the user 'selects' their parent option. This will make more sense when we see the module in action.

### Inner Option

Inner Option is again a repeater field. When we click on **Add One** - we'd be prompted by two more fields.
![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/UQGCK5U.png)

The first field **Inner Option** is the title for our nested question's option title, and the second field **Inner Option URL** is the URL which will be prompted as a **Button** to our user once they select this specific option in our nested question.

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/8dLreUN.png)

As this is a repeater field, we can add as many options we'd like to our nested question.

If the user, let's say - choose Absolute > Nested Option 3 - the URL for that specific combination will render at the bottom as a button:
![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/GqMAytz.png)

> The title of the button has been set to stay dynamic. So that it takes the current combination and prints that. We can see the selected combination in the white bordered box in the screenshot below.

This might sound a little complicated, however is pretty easy once you give it a try. If, for any reason, there's any confusion - please feel free to reach out to your associated Account Manager.

We see the module in action in the next set of articles.
